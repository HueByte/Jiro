## Code Naming Theme

Jiro uses Japanese-inspired code names that reflect the spirit and theme of each major release. The names are chosen to be:

- **Meaningful**: Reflecting the key improvements or theme of the release
- **Memorable**: Easy to remember and reference
- **Cultural**: Inspired by Japanese concepts and philosophy

## Release History

### Minor Releases (v0.1.x)

### Major Releases (v1.x.x+)

- **Hatsumeika** (発明家) - "Inventor" - for innovative features

- **Chouwa** (調和) - "Harmony" - for integration and compatibility releases
- **Chouten** (頂点) - "Peak/Summit" - for performance and optimization releases

## Guidelines

When choosing a code name for a new release:

1. **Consider the Theme**: What is the main focus of this release?
2. **Check Cultural Accuracy**: Ensure proper understanding of Japanese terms
3. **Maintain Consistency**: Follow the established pattern and style
4. **Document Meaning**: Always include both Japanese characters and English meaning
5. **Test Pronunciation**: Ensure the name is reasonably easy to pronounce

## Usage

Code names should be used in:

- Changelog titles
- Release announcements
- Marketing materials
- Internal documentation
- Git tags (optional: `v3.0.0-shinpo`)

The code name appears in the format: `Version "CodeName"` (e.g., `v0.1.1-beta "Kouzou"`)
